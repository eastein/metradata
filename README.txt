This is a Tornado web application to do Metra train tracking better.

# TODO

* Main template
* maybe redo the dropdowns in metradata using react js or something...
* maybe use eric meyers' reset css?

* do weather at both ends...?
* use templar's icons for weather http://templarian.com/2014/12/10/material_design_weather_icons/
* wikipedia might have station locations for metra http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55th%E2%80%9356th%E2%80%9357th_Street_%28Metra_station%29

* use http://metrarail.com/content/metra/en/home/jcr:content/trainTracker.json to get the acquity url
* pull in jquery
* caching layer for runs
* add option to metraapi to work in an asynchronous manner and use it here

## Lower Priority

* General exception handler and a single common json serializer
